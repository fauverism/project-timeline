An HTML template for online project timelines.

## What is a project timeline and why would I use one?
A project timeline is a tool for keeping track of the progress of a design project. The timeline lives online (either publically available or password protected), so that everyone involved in the team has access to it.

The benefits of using a project timeline:
- Serves as a centralized hub for the project
- Easily and visually view project progress
- Provides an archive for project artifacts
- Keep clients and team members up to speed with design progress
- Lives at a URL that doesn't change

TODOS
- create a master page for all projects that will link to project pages
- create a sidebar for logging tech, estimate, pomodoros, harvest data, links, repos, etc.
